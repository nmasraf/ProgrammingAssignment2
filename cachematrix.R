## Programming Assignment#2: R function to cache potentially time-consuming computations
## function makeCacheMatrix takes an input matrix and returns a list which essentially gets/sets mean into the 
## vector and retrieves them if they exist already. makeCacheMatrix has the following libraries that achieves the above:
# set the value of the vector
# get the value of the vector
# set the value of the mean
# get the value of the mean

## the list x will be used in cacheSolve ()

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        
}
